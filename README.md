# PREGO: online mistake detection in PRocedural EGOcentric videos (CVPR '24)

### [[Project Page]](https://www.pinlab.org/prego) [[Paper]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Flaborea_PREGO_Online_Mistake_Detection_in_PRocedural_EGOcentric_Videos_CVPR_2024_paper.html)

The official PyTorch implementation of the IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) '24 paper **PREGO: online mistake detection in PRocedural EGOcentric videos**.

### ðŸš§ REPO UNDER CONSTRUCTION

PREGO is the first online one-class classification model for mistake detection in procedural egocentric videos. It uses an online action recognition component to model current actions and a symbolic reasoning module to predict next actions, detecting mistakes by comparing the recognized current action with the expected future one. We evaluate this on two adapted datasets, Assembly101-O and Epic-tent-O, for online benchmarking of procedural mistake detection.
